      **Jurisdictional Options Memo**

      **1. Comparative Analysis of Venues**
      - **Venue:** International Criminal Court (ICC)
      - **Pros:** [e.g., Highest authority]
      - **Cons:** [e.g., Complementarity challenges]

      **2. Strategic Recommendation**
      - **Primary Strategy:** [e.g., Pursue case via Universal Jurisdiction in State C.]
      - **Viability Confidence:** 3/5
      - **Fallback Strategy:** [e.g., Submit communication to UN Human Rights Committee.]
      - **Viability Confidence:** 5/5

      **Self-Critique / Key Hurdles:**
      - The primary strategy is vulnerable to political pressure.
      - A lack of direct evidence linking perpetrators to the command of State B is the greatest evidentiary weakness.

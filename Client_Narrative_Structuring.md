      **Mitigation Narrative**
      [The complete, well-written narrative in paragraph form.]
      ---
      **Self-Critique:**
      - **Cultural & Linguistic Notes:** The client repeatedly refers to the community elder as "tÃ­o." This is an honorific signifying respect, not a literal uncle.
      - **Possible Biases Detected:** The client's account of the group's actions may reflect memory conformity from discussing the event with others.
      - **Areas Needing Corroboration:** The client's account of a prior traumatic event would be significantly strengthened by supporting documents (e.g., medical records).
